7. Explain and demonstrate a system using jwt's, focusing on both client and server side.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a more modern approach to authentication. As the web moves to a greater separation between the client and server,
JWT provides a wonderful alternative to traditional cookie based authentication models.

JWTs provide a way for clients to authenticate every request without having to maintain a session or repeatedly pass login credentials to the server.

In other ways JWT is a fantastic and simple way to communicate trusted information across untrusted channels.

JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA

Benefits of JWT:

•	They are Compact: Because of its smaller size, JWTs can be sent through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
•	 The payload contains all the required information about the user, avoiding the need to query the database more than once
