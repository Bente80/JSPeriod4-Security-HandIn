4. Explain and demonstrate ways to protect user passwords on our backends, and why this is necessary.

The reason why this is nessesary is that in general we only have a user with a unique name and a password as the schema for our DB. But we
also don’t want to store the passwords in clear text, so whenever we want to save a user, we salt the password and store this value to our
DB. This also means, we have to add a special compare method to compare those passwords, so we never get our hands on the real value of
the user’s password! In this way we protect the endpoints.
